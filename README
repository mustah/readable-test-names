Intellij IDEA plugin - additional refactoring option of method names
======================================================================

It is now possible to refactor method names from camel case to be separated with under score.

For example, if you write the method name:

 * "testShouldReturnNegativeNumber"

 then this new refactoring option will suggest these two alternatives:

   1. "test_Should_Return_Negative_Number"

   and one without the "test"-prefix, as:

   2. "Should_Return_Negative_Number"


This new refactoring option can be found at the very bottom of the refactorings menu, called "Rename camel case to underscore".
